3) Creating a Candidate

	When starting a new game you'll go to the candidate creation screen. The first thing you'll
do is choose the number of human and AI players for your game. The maximum total number of players 
is 6. Once the number of players is chosen, the first Human player's candidate is created. Each 
player gets 6 dev points to spend on attributes.

	NAME- The candidates name. It costs nothing.

	CHARISMA- This value affects the success of candidates campaigning activities.It's range is 
0-3 and the higher the value the better the candidate is likely to do when campaigning,fundraising 
ect.. The cost is 1 dev point per point of charisma.

	INCOME- The candidates base income. It has a ragne of 0-3, and costs 1 dev point per point 
of income.Additional income may be gained from your party or a special interest group. Each turn the 
candidate's total income is added to his funds. Funds are needed for most actions in the game.

	PARTY- The candidate's political party. It may provide an income bonus or volunteers to help 
you campaign.
	Here is a list of available parties and their stats;

Party		Point Cost	Income Bonus	Additional Volunteers	Team Color
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Democratic	3		2		2			 Magenta
Republican	3		4		1			 Blue
Libertarian	1		1		0			 Black
Green		1		0		1			 Green
Constitution	1		1		0			 Red	
Independant	0		0		0			 Gold

	The team color is displayed on the ties of the volunteers working for that parties 
candidate. The bonuses listed in the table are for a candidate with 100% support of his party.
The actual support will depend on how close the candidates stances on issues matches that of his 
party, which brings us to...
		
	ISSUES- Each candidate must have a stance on issues that come up during the campaign. The 
stance's are represented by a value in the range of -2 to 2. Generally -2 means total opposition 
to what is at issue and 2 means total support. The defualt stance for all issues is 0. You can 
modify your stances on the issues by pressing the "set issues" button. The issues screen will pop up
which lists the issues and what the stances specifically mean for that issue. You can adjust each 
issue using the dropdown next to it. 
	The top of screen show the percentage of party support you have. That percentage is also 
the percentage of party bonusses you get, thus if your candidate is on the Democratic ticket and 
has 50% support you get 1 additional income and 1 volunteer.You can match your party's stances and 
get 100% support by pressing the "Match Party" button. The reasons not to match your party would be 
to match the stances of states you want to win or special interests you want to gain the support of.
If you have chosen to be independant, the percentage of support can be ignored.

Here is a list of issues and each party's stance on them.

	States and special interests also have stances on issues. A states stance on the issue of 
the day is compared to the candidates stance when performing actons in that state, and the 
difference between them affects the outcome.
	Special Interest are more likely to support you if your stances match theirs on the issues 
they care about.

Here's a list of the states and the issues on which their stance is positive or negative. On all
other issues their stance has a value of 0. For the purposes of this game D.C. is treated as a state.

	AVATAR-The model that represents your candidate. You can use the "Prev" and "next" buttons 
at the bottom of the screen to switch between the available avatars.

	Once you have finished making your candidate, click the "Accept" button. If there are 
additional human players, each will get a turn to make their candidate. When the last human player
clicks the "Accept" button, the game map will come up and play will begin.

4) Playing the Game
	As with the real election the goal is to get more electoral votes than the other candidate. 
It is important to remember that that all calculations of support during the game are projections, 
not guaranteed votes. You can't be sure who's going to win until the election at the end of the game,
unless the projected winner's lead is substantial.

	DISPLAY-You will see a U.S. map with all 50 states and D.c. outlined. The numbers on each 
state are its electoral votes. 
	Ech state has a spherical waypoint that displays the flag of the party whose candidate has 
the most support in that state. States with a tie(swing states) display a black question mark on a 
gray background. 
	Candidates and their volunteers will be placed around the waypoints of random;y chosen 
states. When the game begins the camera will be centered on the candidate of the first human player,
and it will have a pick target under it. Volunteers will have ties bearing the team color of the 
party their candidate belongs to.

	There are buttons and displays at the top of the screen and more buttons at the bottom. First 
I'll go over the displays;

Issue of the Day- When campaigning or advertising, your stance on this issue will be compaired to 
the stance of the target state. Players can bid for a chance to choose next turns issue. The highest 
bidder gets to choose. If no one bids, or its the first turn, it will be chosen at random.

Turns Left-The number of turns remaining before the election, not including the present turn.

	Now, about the buttons at the top of the screen;

"Bid"-Click this button to place a bid for the issue of the day.

"Menu"- Clicking this button pulls up a menu for saving, loading, or exiting a game.

"End Turn"-Click this to end your turn. If there are human players after you, They will get a chance 
to act, otherwise the AI players will go and then a new turn will start.

"Toggle AI Log"- Click this button to display or remove a log of AI player actions 
during the previous turn. AI players go after the human players, so bringing it up on the first turn
will display nothing. This log will automatically appear at the beginning of each turn after the 
first.
  
	The buttons on the bottom of the screen are for the various actions you can take on your 
turn. The ones on the left are for singel actions. The ones on the right are for repeatable actions.
These actions are explained in subsequent sections of this manual.
 
	KEY AND MOUSE COMMANDS- To move the camera around the map. use the A,S,D, and W keys as you
would in an FPS.
	Left click on your candidate or volunteer to select him/her. You can't select characters 
that are not yours. Middle click on any character to get information on the candidate or the 
candidate he works for. This info includes the candidates party flag that is displayed on state way 
points.

	SINGLE ACTIONS- These are actions that can be peformed once per turn by your candidate and 
each volunteer you have. To perform the action click the appropriate button at the bottom of the 
screen. For the purposes of calculating success, volunteers have a charisma of 0.

	The possibel actions are;

Fly- This action lets you fly to any state in the union. Choose your destination and hit "Accept".
It cost 2 funds.

Drive- This action lets you drive to a state bordering the one you're in. Choose your destination 
and hit "Accept". It cost 1 fund.

Campaign- Your avatar or volunteer tries to raise support in the state he is in, through speeches,
canvasing, and/or public gestures. It costs 1 fund. Degree of success is affected by the charisma of 
the acting character and how close your stance on the issue of the day is to the state's. This 
action can backfire, resulting in less support.  

Fundraise- Your avatar or volunteer attempts to raise funds in the state he is in. It cost nothing. 
Degree of Success is affected by the same parameters as campaigning, but success is less likely.

Recruit- Your avatar or volunteer attempts to recuit a volunteer in the state he is in. It cost 
nothing. Degree of Success is affected by the same parameters as campaigning, but success is less 
likely. If successful, a volunteer will appear in that state, and be able to act that turn.

Pander- Your avatar or volunteer attempts to gain the endorsement of a Special Interest. It costs 
nothing. Degree of Success is affected by the charisma of your avatar and how close his stances on
the issues are to the stances of the issues the Special Interest cares about. Special Interest will 
only support one candidate, so if they have already endorsed one, you must have closer agreement 
on the issues they care about than their currently endorsed candidate to convince them to switch 
their endorsement to you. An endorsement means you will get income from them each turn and/or 
volunteers.

	Here's a list of the beneftis by Special Interests
 
Special Interest		Income/Turn	Volunteers			
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agribusiness			2
Aerospace Industry		2
Banks/Investment Firms		4
Big Three Auto			1		1
Christian Fundamentalists	1		1
Civil Rights Groups				2
Coal Industry			2
Drug Industry			3
Environmentalists		1		1
Insurance Companies		2
Labor Unions			1		1
Left Wing Celebrity		1		1
NRA						1
Oil/Gas Industry		3
Right Wing Celebrity		1		1 

	REPEATABLE ACTIONS- These actions can be performed by the player as many times a turn as he 
can afford. 
	The possible actions are;

Advertise- This action allows you to advertise in a chosen state. You can either choose a positive 
ad to try and raise your support in that state, or a negative add to try an lower a chosen opponent's 
support in that state. A negative add can have a greater effect. Degree of success is affected by the 
charisma of the candidate and how close your stance on the issue of the day is to the state's. This 
action can backfire, resulting the opposite of the intended effect.

Flip Flop- You can "clarify" your position on an issue to improve your chances of successfully 
acting in certain states, or to gain the endorsement of a Special Interest. Doing so will alter the 
support you get from your party, which may result in loss of party income or volunteers. Flip 
flopping when you have an endorsement from a Special Interest may increase your risk of that 
endorsement being lost to someone else.

	VICTORY CONDITIONS- After the last turn is played, the election screen will pop up. In the 
center are the names of each candidate with the electoral votes the have gained. At this point the 
values are all 0 because the election hasn't been held yet.At the bottom of the screen is the name 
of the projected winner based on who has the most projected electoral votes, but as previously 
mentioned, being the projected winner does not gaurantee actuallywinning. A small amount of 
randomness is built in to the actual vote tally.
	Click on the "Tally Votes" button to run the election. Each candidates electoral results 
will be listed by there names, and the winner will be displayed at the bottom.
